# Lavender Haven

![mockup](readme_img/amiresponsive.png)

For this last project I got inspired by the small business located in Dalmatia, Croatia. Hvar island is magical place well known for its lavander fields. I looked up their website and not much but the most important information was displayed for the users, so I thought of making the lavander as a hero of my last project and turning the idea into something a bit more advanced.

My website is a fully functioning B2C and B2B e-commerce application site and the main point is for the user to be able to make a payment for their purchases. But I really wanted to implement more to it than just a webstore, so the websites main features including the 'articles', 'checkout', 'cart', 'account' are the 'about', 'blog', 'contacts', 'testimonials' and the users have the option for a 'newsletter' subscription. The website provides the possibilty for the 'super user' to fully perform the CRUD actions on the 'articles' from both the admin panel and in the front-end and the users can do the same but with 'testimonials', but for UD in CRUD the testimonials must be first approved by the 'super user'.

The websites content in most parts is available for everyone. User can purchase articles as authenticated and as non-authenticated, but some actions as liking the blog post or leaving a testimonial requires a login.

I really wanted to show the skills I have learned during this course with CI. Programming its not easy and it will take me a loads of practice to get to the level I really want to be but I hope that one day I will be the senior and be the person to go to.
